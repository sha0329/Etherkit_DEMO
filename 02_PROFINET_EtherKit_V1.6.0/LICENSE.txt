8.1. By Licensee.  Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Renesas and its Affiliates and its and their officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, licensors, distributors and suppliers from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, settlements, expenses (including without limitation attorneys' fees and other costs of litigation), and causes of action arising out of or relating to Licensee's use or misuse of the Licensed Software or Licensee's breach or alleged breach of this Agreement.


9. GENERAL.

9.1. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with its Exhibits, constitutes the entire understanding between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions, negotiations, conditions and agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties.  Any modification of this Agreement shall be effective only if made in writing and signed by authorized representatives of the parties.  It is expressly agreed that any terms appearing on the face or reverse side of any form, including an invoice, order form, acknowledgement or confirmation, that are different from or in addition to the terms provided in this Agreement are not binding on the parties, even if signed and returned, and the parties object to any such different or additional terms.  Any offer by either party and any acceptance of such an offer by the other party is limited to the terms in this Agreement only, and each party's acceptance of any offer is expressly made conditional on assent to the terms of this Agreement.

9.2. Exclusion of Terms.  The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any provisions of any law adopting exactly or in modified form the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act ("UCITA") shall not be applicable to this Agreement.  Furthermore, both parties waive any and all rights arising from any such law.  The provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

9.3. Governing Law and Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of Japan without giving effect to any choice of law rule.  Each party (a) hereby irrevocably submits itself to and consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of [Tokyo District Court in Japan for the purposes of any action, claim, suit or proceeding in connection with any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the Agreement, and (b) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such court(s), that the action, claim, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, claim, suit or proceeding is improper.

9.4. Assignment.  Licensee may not assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by merger, change of control, operation of law or otherwise, this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Renesas.  Any purported assignment, transfer or delegation by Licensee shall be null and void.  Renesas may assign, sell, transfer, delegate or otherwise dispose of this Agreement or any rights or obligations under this Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

9.5. Remedies.  The rights and remedies of either party as set forth in this Agreement are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies now or hereafter provided by applicable law or at equity.

9.6. Equitable Relief.  Licensee recognizes that the covenants contained in Section 2 and Section 3 hereof are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Renesas, that Renesas would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of such covenants, and that Licensee's breach or threatened breach of such covenants shall cause Renesas irreparable harm and significant injury, the amount of which shall be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus, making any remedy at law or in damages inadequate.  Therefore, Licensee agrees that Renesas shall have the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement and for any other relief Renesas deems appropriate, without the necessity of posting of any bond or security.  This right shall be in addition to any other remedy available to Renesas in law or equity.

9.7. Waiver.  None of the conditions of this Agreement shall be considered waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the waiving party.  No such waiver shall be a waiver of any past or future default, breach or modification of any of the conditions of this Agreement unless expressly stipulated in such waiver.

9.8. Partial Invalidity.  Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, or inoperative, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected and shall continue in effect and the invalid provision shall be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy such invalidity.

9.9. Notices.  Any written notices to be given hereunder by either party shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon mailing the notice to the party to be served at the address as stated above and in the case of Licensee, e-mail address provided in connection with the click-through of this Agreement.

9.10. Relationship of Parties.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed as creating a joint venture, partnership, agency, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties.  Neither party nor its agents have any authority of any kind to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever, and the relationship of the parties is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent contractors.

9.11. Export Administration.  Licensee shall comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations (collectively "Export Controls").  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not, and Licensee shall require Licensee's representatives not to, export, direct or transfer the Licensed Software, or any direct product thereof, to or use the Licensed Software in any destination, person or entity restricted or prohibited by the Export Controls.  Licensee represents and warrants that Licensee is not such a person and is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such destination or entity.

9.12. Government Rights.  If Licensee is, or are entering into this Agreement on behalf of, any agency or instrumentality of the United States Government, the Licensed Software is "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," and pursuant to FAR 12.212 or DFARS 227.7202, and their successors, as applicable, use, reproduction, and disclosure of the Licensed Software are governed by the terms of this Agreement.

9.13. Interpretation.  The headings in this Agreement are solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect its interpretation.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the singular includes the plural, and the plural includes the singular.  Unless otherwise specifically stated, references to Sections refer to sections in the main body of this Agreement and the words "herein," "hereof," and "hereunder" and other words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or paragraph.  The words "include," "includes," "including" and derivative forms of them shall be deemed followed by the phrase "without limitation" regardless of whether such phrase appears there (and with no implication being drawn from its inconsistent inclusion or non-inclusion).  Any ambiguities in this Agreement shall not be strictly construed against the drafter of the language concerned but shall be resolved by applying the most reasonable interpretation under the circumstances, giving full consideration to the intentions of the parties at the time of contracting.  This Agreement shall not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation.
